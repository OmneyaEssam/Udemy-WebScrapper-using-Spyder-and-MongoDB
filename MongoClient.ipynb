Your journey through the fascinating world of deep reinforcement learning will start at the very beginning. So, we’ll begin by answering the question: what is deep reinforcement learning, exactly? Well, reinforcement learning is ultimately about building code that can figure out how to perform complex tasks by itself. And deep reinforcement learning refers to approaches where the knowledge that the code builds over time is represented with a deep neural network.</td>\n",

We’ll develop basic methods for applications that include finding known models in images, depth recovery from stereo, camera calibration, image stabilization, automated alignment (e.g. panoramas), tracking, and action recognition.  We focus less on the machine learning aspect of CV as that is really classification theory best learned in an ML course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus of the course is to develop the intuitions and mathematics of the methods in lecture, and then to learn about the difference between theory and practice in the problem sets. All algorithms work perfectly in the slides. But remember what &lt;a href=\"http://yogiberramuseum.org/just-for-fun/yogisms/\"&gt;Yogi Berra&lt;/a&gt; said: In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is. (Einstein said something similar but who knows more about real life?)

Students with backgrounds in Operations or Development who are interested in managing container based infrastructure with Kubernetes are recommended to enroll!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this course you will learn to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Containerize an application by creating Docker config files and build processes to produce all the necessary Docker images&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configure and launch an auto-scaling, self-healing Kubernetes cluster&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use Kubernetes to manage deploying, scaling, and updating your applications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Employ best practices for using containers in general, and specifically Kubernetes, when architecting and developing new microservices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</td>\n",

If you would like to gain more technical skills and learn more about Javascript and open web standards, then you should complete Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 in order to prepare for the final project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would like to complete the final project using d3.js, you should have some experience reading and using documentation. For example, you should be able to code a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop in Javascript or be able to look up the syntax to work with strings and arrays in Javascript. We recommend taking the &lt;a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Javascript Basics&lt;/a&gt; course if you have little to no experience with Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

Twitter open sourced Storm in 2011, and it graduated to a top-level Apache project in September, 2014.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting from basic distributed concepts presented during our first Udacity-Twitter Storm Hackathon, link Storm concepts to Storm syntax to scalably drive Word Cloud visualizations with Vagrant, Ubuntu, Maven, Flask, Redis, and d3.  Link to the public Twitter gardenhose stream to process live tweets, parse embedded URLs, and calculate Top worldwide hashtags.  Extend beyond Storm basics by exploring multi-language capabilities in Python, integrate open source components, and implement real-time streaming joins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In your final project, follow real-time trending topics by implementing the data pipeline to visualize only tweets that contain Top worldwide hashtags.  Extend your project by exploring the Twitter API, or any data source, alongside Hackathon participants as they design their own ideas, receive feedback from Karthik, and open source a final project calculating real-time tweet sentiment and geolocation to drive a U.S. Map.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this course is to give you solid foundations for developing, analyzing, and implementing parallel and locality-efficient algorithms. This course focuses on theoretical underpinnings. To give a practical feeling for how algorithms map to and behave on real systems, we will supplement algorithmic theory with hands-on exercises on modern HPC systems, such as Cilk Plus or OpenMP on shared memory nodes, CUDA for graphics co-processors (GPUs), and MPI and PGAS models for distributed memory systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This course is a graduate-level introduction to scalable parallel algorithms. \"Scale\" really refers to two things: efficient as the problem size grows, and efficient as the system size (measured in numbers of cores or compute nodes) grows. To really scale your algorithm in both of these senses, you need to be smart about reducing asymptotic complexity the way you’ve done for sequential algorithms since CS 101; but you also need to think about reducing communication and data movement. This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques you’ll need to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The techniques you’ll encounter covers the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and many core shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). You will see these techniques applied to fundamental problems, like sorting, search on trees and graphs, and linear algebra, among others. The practical aspect of this course is implementing the algorithms and techniques you’ll learn to run on real parallel and distributed systems, so you can check whether what appears to work well in theory also translates into practice. (Programming models you’ll use include Cilk Plus, OpenMP, and MPI, and possibly others.)&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

Many startups fail by not validating their ideas early on with real-life customers. In order to mitigate that, students will learn how to get out of the building and search for the real pain points and unmet needs of customers. Only with these can the entrepreneur find a proper solution and establish a suitable business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a startup is not simply building an execution plan for a business model that the entrepreneur thinks will work, but rather, a search for the actual business model itself.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

So, we’ll begin by answering the question: what is deep reinforcement learning, exactly? Well, reinforcement learning is ultimately about building code that can figure out how to perform complex tasks by itself. And deep reinforcement learning refers to approaches where the knowledge that the code builds over time is represented with a deep neural network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "17   <p>This course covers methods for organizing your code, both conceptually and literally. You’ll learn the importance of separating concerns when writing JavaScript, gaining hands-on experience along the way. Separating concerns can be done with or without an organizational library or framework. We’ll learn how to separate concerns without one, and then we’ll explore an organizational library together. You’ll also learn strategies for exploring other libraries and frameworks on your own.</p><p>By the end of this course, you’ll understand (from experience) the importance of code organization, and how to implement it with either vanilla JavaScript or an organizational library or framework. Your applications will start looking clean and professional—not just to your users, but also to anyone who looks at the code driving your applications.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "25   <p>This class explores how computation impacts the entire workflow of photography, which is traditionally aimed at capturing light from a 3D scene to form a 2D image. A detailed study of the perceptual, technical and computational aspects of forming pictures, and more precisely the capture and depiction of reality on a (mostly 2D) medium of images is undertaken over the entire term. The scientific, perceptual, and artistic principles behind image-making will be emphasized, especially as impacted and changed by computation.</p><p>Topics include the relationship between pictorial techniques and the human visual system; intrinsic limitations of 2D representations and their possible compensations; and technical issues involving capturing light to form images. Technical aspects of image capture and rendering, and exploration of how such a medium can be used to its maximum potential, will be examined.

       "64   <p>This course provides an introduction to computer vision including fundamentals of image formation, camera imaging geometry, feature detection and matching, multiview geometry including stereo, motion estimation and tracking, and classification. We’ll develop basic methods for applications that include finding known models in images, depth recovery from stereo, camera calibration, image stabilization, automated alignment (e.g. panoramas), tracking, and action recognition.  We focus less on the machine learning aspect of CV as that is really classification theory best learned in an ML course.</p><p>The focus of the course is to develop the intuitions and mathematics of the methods in lecture, and then to learn about the difference between theory and practice in the problem sets. All algorithms work perfectly in the slides. But remember what <a href=\"http://yogiberramuseum.org/just-for-fun/yogisms/\">Yogi Berra</a> said: In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is.

You will start by making a low fidelity paper prototype, conducting research with users, and using that research to inform your next iteration. Together with InVision we’ll guide you through creating interactive prototypes. This means you don’t have to code an app before putting it in front of users! Along the way, you’ll learn how and where prototyping fits into your app design process and how you can use prototyping to become a better entrepreneur.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "106  <p>At first it may seem strange to consider monetization before a game is even completed, and many developers leave this as an afterthought. But monetization should be built into the fabric of a game from the beginning, because a clearly defined and understood monetization strategy can have tremendous impact on design decisions made during the development process. This kind of forward-thinking approach is especially important in today’s highly competitive game market, and keeping monetization strategy front-of-mind throughout can be the difference between product success and failure. </p><p>This course will teach you how to make your game stand out in a very crowded field, and encourage people to pay for game features that will define the ultimate success of your product.</p><p>Currently, most game apps are free to play, and many users are looking for something simple and entertaining without the risk of making a purchase. We&#39;ll look at the most successful premium and freemium games, and discuss the most effective strategies for monetization.

       "127  <p>The goal of this course is to give you solid foundations for developing, analyzing, and implementing parallel and locality-efficient algorithms. This course focuses on theoretical underpinnings. To give a practical feeling for how algorithms map to and behave on real systems, we will supplement algorithmic theory with hands-on exercises on modern HPC systems, such as Cilk Plus or OpenMP on shared memory nodes, CUDA for graphics co-processors (GPUs), and MPI and PGAS models for distributed memory systems.</p><p>This course is a graduate-level introduction to scalable parallel algorithms. \"Scale\" really refers to two things: efficient as the problem size grows, and efficient as the system size (measured in numbers of cores or compute nodes) grows. To really scale your algorithm in both of these senses, you need to be smart about reducing asymptotic complexity the way you’ve done for sequential algorithms since CS 101; but you also need to think about reducing communication and data movement. This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques you’ll need to do so.</p><p>The techniques you’ll encounter covers the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and many core shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). You will see these techniques applied to fundamental problems, like sorting, search on trees and graphs, and linear algebra, among others. The practical aspect of this course is implementing the algorithms and techniques you’ll learn to run on real parallel and distributed systems, so you can check whether what appears to work well in theory also translates into practice.

       "144  <p>In the 21st century, embedded systems are the systems of future with cellular phones, smart-phones, tablets becoming the dominant platforms for computing and communication. The ubiquity of information and the associated need for the computation that accompanies it is driving this revolution only to be accelerated by the new paradigms such as the Internet-of-Things (IoT). These platforms are clearly very different in terms of their processing requirements which are very unique: real-time needs, high performance but at low energy, compact-code and data segments, and most importantly ever changing software stack. Such unique requirements have led to a complete redesign and reinvention of the both hardware and the software stack from ground up, for example, brand new processors such as ARM, DSPs, network processors were invented all the way up to new virtual machines such as Dalvik, new operating systems such as Android and new programming models and compiler optimizations.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "172  <p>This course is designed to teach students how to understand and identify the differences between the Objective-C and Swift programming languages, and especially, how to rewrite from the former to the latter. Understanding communications between the two languages—called &quot;interoperability&quot;—is becoming more and more important for developers, particularly as we prepare for the arrival of Swift 3.0. In the course, students will write classes and add functionality to classes by writing and calling methods. After learning some basic Objective-C syntax, students will examine and break down an app written in Objective-C and rewrite it in Swift. The course will conclude with a review of and practice with the most common challenges for interoperability between Objective-C and Swift.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Many startups fail by not validating their ideas early on with real-life customers. In order to mitigate that, students will learn how to get out of the building and search for the real pain points and unmet needs of customers. Only with these can the entrepreneur find a proper solution and establish a suitable business model.</p><p>Building a startup is not simply building an execution plan for a business model that the entrepreneur thinks will work, but rather, a search for the actual business model itself.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Towards the end of the course we will provide instructions on how to download your app on an iPhone (in case you do have access to a physical device.)</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "99   <p>Regardless of your programming background, you can learn about data visualization and design principles in Lesson 1a and Lesson 2a without the following recommended background.</p><p>To succeed in this course, you should to be familiar with basic programming principles, including data types (strings, arrays, booleans, etc.), <code>if else</code> statements, and <code>for</code> loops. You should also be able to describe concepts like functions and objects. Our <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101\" target=\"_blank\">Intro to Computer Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036\" target=\"_blank\">Programming Fundamentals with Python</a> courses are great places to get started.</p><p>Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS (structuring and styling a web page) is not required but highly recommended. We suggest taking the <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/html-and-css-syntax--ud001\" target=\"_blank\">Intro to HTML and CSS</a> course if you have no experience with HTML or CSS.</p><p>This course is unique in that the final project can be completed using either dimple.js or d3.js. The visualization library, dimple.js, is easier to use than d3.js and requires less background knowledge. Furthermore, a graphic can be created in considerably fewer lines of code using dimple.js as opposed to d3.js.</p><p>So why should you learn d3.js?</p><p>Data Driven Documents (d3.js) allows you to build highly customized graphics. If you would like to gain more technical skills and learn more about Javascript and open web standards, then you should complete Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 in order to prepare for the final project.</p><p>If you would like to complete the final project using d3.js, you should have some experience reading and using documentation. For example, you should be able to code a <code>for</code> loop in Javascript or be able to look up the syntax to work with strings and arrays in Javascript. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803\" target=\"_blank\">Javascript Basics</a> course if you have little to no experience with Javascript.</p>  \n",
